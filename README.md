## Spirograph:

This project was inspired by the beautiful patterns that can be created by Spirograph Sets
I looked into the mathematics behind spirograph curves, and attempted to write some code to model and render them.

A live version is available here: [http://spirograph.juddn.com/](http://spirograph.juddn.com/ "http://spirograph.juddn.com/")

You can pretty much type in any parameters and you will get some sort of result, but obviously, some are better than others. 
It usually works best when one of the wheels (inner or outer) remains fixed, and the other changing. 
Setting the outer wheel to a prime number (eg 97) also gives relatively stable results.

The numbers for the inner and outer wheels correspond to the number of teeth on real-world Spirograph gears. See here: [http://spirographicart.com/spirograph-pattern-guide/](http://spirographicart.com/spirograph-pattern-guide/ "http://spirographicart.com/spirograph-pattern-guide/") (unlike the real world, the inner wheel can actually be bigger than the outer etc)
